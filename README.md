# 🥗 Recipe Recommendation

**ROSPL Mini Project – Recent Open Source Project Lab**
*Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*

## 📘 Overview

The **Recipe Recommendation Web App** allows users to search for meals based on **ingredients** or **country/area**.
It uses the public [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch recipe data, including instructions, meal images, and YouTube video links.

This project was selected and modified as part of the **Recent Open Source Project Lab (ROSPL)** to understand and contribute to open-source front-end development.
